Query Descriptions

Query.sql descriptions
======================
### General Queries
Sees what cards from Born of the Gods have flavor text.

Find recently made decks by good players younger than 24. "Good" here is defined as a player with more than 900 wins and less than 10 losses.

Find retailers with rated with a 4 or better out of 5 that are located in Albuquerque, Phoenix, and Tempe. The idea for this was to perhaps implement some geo-location based off the user's current location.

### Join Queries
Provides additional information about the cards that retailers sell, such as their name, price, quantity, etc. This would be an ideal view to construct later on.

Shows recently talked about cards and the players and blogs that mentioned them, this could also be a useful view.

### Union Queries
Shows the full set list. Potentially there could be sets that have been announced but do not have cards unveiled, and this could handle that corner case.

### Group-by Queries
Shows the average mythic rare card price by retailer.

### Order-by Queries
Shows the sets with cards with the most flavor text in them. This is more of a fun query to show what sets have the most backstory associated with them and I haven't been able to find anything like it on other sites.

Show the top ten players based on wins.

### Distinct Queries
Shows distinct common cards, cards are often reprinted in later sets, so this shows all the names of distinct cards.

### Aggregate Queries
Shows the minimum price for a specific card, in this case it is Brimaz, King of Oreskos for all retailers. This is helpful for a store front where the user would like to buy a card at the lowest possible price.

Update.sql descriptions
=======================

### Insert Queries
Adds the new set "Journey into Nyx" into the Sets table also provides additional text that is only available on the Gatherer website that may be enticing to customers.

Create a new player in the database.

### Update Queries
The store "Active Imagination" is having a sale on all uncommons where the price is now 25 cents per card.

Update player's rankings based on their number of wins. Players with the most wins are higher ranks than players with less wins.

A new season has started so all the player wins, losses, and draws must be reset and all the rankings must be equal.

### Delete Queries
Delete a blog and the traces that it talked about specific cards and decks within its content. Requires deletion in multiple tables.

A store goes out of business, therefore we should delete the store's location and the cards that it sells from the database.
