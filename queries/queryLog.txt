| Ashiok's Adept           | Born of the Gods | "Every nightmare is a caged bird that yearns to be set free."

—Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver                                                                                                                                            |
| Aspect of Hydra          | Born of the Gods | "Even alone I outnumber you."                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Asphyxiate               | Born of the Gods | "Some poisons enter through the blood. Some are ingested. Some are inhaled. All ways through which mortals draw strength are paths for poison."

—Agathe, priest of Pharika                                                         |
| Bile Blight              | Born of the Gods | Not an arrow loosed, javelin thrown, nor sword raised. None were needed.                                                                                                                                                             |
| Black Oak of Odunos      | Born of the Gods | Phenax promised the newly dead souls they would be spared from Erebos. In this, he did not lie.                                                                                                                                      |
| Bolt of Keranos          | Born of the Gods | The breakthroughs granted by Keranos, god of epiphany, can be surprisingly literal.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Charging Badger          | Born of the Gods | "If the hierarchies of nature were determined by ferocity alone, the badger would be lord of the beasts."

—Anthousa of Setessa                                                                                                     |
| Claim of Erebos          | Born of the Gods | Priests of Erebos give an occasional reminder to mortals who have forgotten their mortality.                                                                                                                                         |
| Crypsis                  | Born of the Gods | Tritons borrow the camouflage of their oceanic prey to become predators on land.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Culling Mark             | Born of the Gods | Hunt without Nylea's leave and you may find yourself the next quarry.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Cyclops of One-Eyed Pass | Born of the Gods | The Champion armed herself to face the cyclops, heedless of her companions' despair.

"How will you defeat it with only one spear?" asked young Althemone.

The Champion raised her weapon. "It has but one eye."
